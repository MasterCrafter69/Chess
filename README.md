# Chess

A program in python to play chess. I like chess and programming and by combining the two I can learn new things about both.

input: algebraic notation
output: agebraic notation

algorithm:

initialize board

player input

validate the move

move the piece in the board 

check game status

switch players

Repeat until a check mate, stalemate or a resign
