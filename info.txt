Algebraic Notation in Chess

Algebraic notation is the most common method used to describe individual moves in a game of chess. It involves labeling each square of the chessboard with a unique coordinate, and then recording each move using these coordinates. The files (vertical columns) are labeled with letters a through h, from the leftmost file (from white's perspective) to the rightmost. The ranks (horizontal rows) are numbered 1 through 8, with rank 1 being the closest to white and rank 8 being the closest to black.

Pieces are indicated by the following letters:

K for King
Q for Queen
R for Rook
N for Knight (to avoid confusion with the King)
B for Bishop
Pawns are not represented by a letter. Instead, the move of a pawn is represented by the name of the square it moves to.
A few examples:

e4: A pawn moves to the square e4.
Nf3: A knight moves to the square f3.
Bxe4: A bishop captures a piece on e4.
Special moves are denoted as:

O-O for kingside castling
O-O-O for queenside castling
e5xd6 or exd6 for pawn capturing on d6
Checks and checkmates are often indicated with "+" and "#", respectively.

PGN (Portable Game Notation)

PGN is a standard format for representing chess games. It's both human-readable and easily processed by computer programs. A PGN file usually contains metadata about the game (like player names, date, event, etc.) followed by the actual moves of the game.

The moves themselves are recorded in the standard algebraic notation. Between moves, comments can be added in curly braces {}. Variations from the main game can be placed in round brackets ().

An example PGN might look like:
[Event "F/S Return Match"]
[Site "Belgrade, Serbia JUG"]
[Date "1992.11.04"]
[Round "29"]
[White "Fischer, Robert J."]
[Black "Spassky, Boris V."]
[Result "1/2-1/2"]

Software designed to read PGN files can play back the game, analyze it, or even search for specific positions or patterns.
